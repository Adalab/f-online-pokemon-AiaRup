![pokedex](docs/static/media/pokemon-image.15df305c.png) <!-- .element height="80px" width="80px" -->

This project is a SPA to consult the different types of pokemon and some features they have. You can filter the pokemons by their name. The API I used for this project is [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Getting Started

You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and then:

1. Download or clone the project repository.
2. Install dependencies with `$ npm install`.
3. Run the project with `$ npm start`.

## Production

You can run `$ npm run build`. This will build the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
